Report: Password Strength Evaluation and Best Practices

*Objective: Understand what makes a password strong and evaluate it using online password strength checkers.

*Method:

Created 7 sample passwords with varying complexity
Tested each using passwordmeter.com
Collected scores and feedback
Researched common password attacks
Summarized findings and best practices

*Passwords Created and Results:

Password		Score	Feedback
password123		43%	Too common, predictable, no symbols
John1998		30%	Contains name and date, easy to guess
P@ssw0rd!		45%	Better, but still similar to common passwords
Ght$28Lpx*		82%	Strong, good length, complex
#RedHorseRuns@58	100%	Excellent, long, unpredictable, complex
Summer2023		35%	Easy to guess, seasonal
qL9&vX#rZ12!		95%	Very strong, high entropy, random characters

Analysis:
Short and predictable passwords (e.g., password123, Summer2023) scored poorly.
Use of names or dates (e.g., John1998) made them weak.
Adding symbols, uppercase, and numbers improved scores.
Random, lengthy, and complex combinations (e.g., qL9&vX#rZ12!) rated as very strong.
Passphrases (e.g., #RedHorseRuns@58) were also strong and easier to remember than random strings.

Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords:
1. Use at least 12â€“16 characters
2. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
3. Avoid personal details (names, birthdays, hobbies)
4. Never use common dictionary words alone
5. Consider using passphrases with random words
6. Change passwords regularly
7. Use different passwords for each account
8. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

* Common Password Attacks:-

1. Brute Force Attacks:
Attackers systematically try every possible combination of characters until they find the correct password.
Slower but effective against short or simple passwords.

2. Dictionary Attacks:
Use precompiled lists of common words or passwords to guess user credentials.
Faster than brute force, but easily defeated by using random or complex passwords.

3. Credential Stuffing:
Attackers reuse stolen username/password pairs from previous data breaches on other websites.
Exploits people who reuse the same password across multiple accounts.

4. Phishing:
Social engineering attack that tricks users into revealing their password, often through fake login pages, emails, or messages.
Bypasses even the strongest passwords if users voluntarily give them away.


* How Password Complexity Affects Security:-
Longer, more complex passwords dramatically increase the time needed for attackers to crack them.
Each added character exponentially improves security.
Randomness defeats dictionary-based guessing.
Passphrases can be easier to memorize while still strong.

* Key Takeaways:-
Simple passwords are easily broken
Password managers can help generate and store complex passwords
Multi-factor authentication adds a crucial second layer of defense
Passphrases are practical for strong and memorable passwords

* Outcome Achieved: Understood password security principles and best practices for creating and evaluating strong passwords.
